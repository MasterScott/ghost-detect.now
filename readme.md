# Installation & Configuration

Clone the repository and install all dependencies by running:

```
~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/ghost-detect.now
~ ❯❯❯ cd ghost-detect.now/
~/ghost-detect.now ❯❯❯ npm install
```

Subsequently, create a `.env` file and declare a variable called `SECRET` (for session security purposes):

```
~/ghost-detect ❯❯❯ echo "SECRET=[your-secret-goes-here]" > .env
~/ghost-detect ❯❯❯ npm start
```

You can then access the service by navigating to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).

# Credits
- `Ghost-Detect.Now` was developed as part of my Node.js learning experience. I have uploaded the code with the intention of helping out others who are also trying to learn the node environment.
- Most of the styling was adapted from [Evil Rabbit](https://twitter.com/evilrabbit_)'s [front site](https://github.com/evilrabbit/front).
- Ghost's logo was taken from the original [ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) website.
